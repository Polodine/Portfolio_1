# Portfolio_1 frontend
Welcome! It's my first site for portfolio that based on frontend only.
Less file has precompiled to css file.
Also realized pressing a certain button to show needed content without reloading the page using ajax, and if the site isn't
 located on a local or another server or some other problem used .html()
